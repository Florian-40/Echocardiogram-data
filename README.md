# Machine learning project : Echocardiogram data set

The goal is to well determine if a patient will survive at least one year after a heart attack with machine learning methods.
You can find the data set on UCI website : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/echocardiogram

You can find google colab codes, data set and information about data in the folder named "codes". In the folder "slides", you can find my oral presentation support.
